    abstract = {One reaction of rivers toward allogenic triggers is the large-scale river channel migration in the form of avulsions or progressive lateral migrations (combing) that are widespread phenomena around the world during the late Quaternary. Because they potentially cause significant human and economic losses and significantly change geomorphic processes in the affected regions, a deeper knowledge about causes and rates is essential and furthermore helps to identify the dominant drivers of regional landscape evolution during different periods. One possible cause for river channel migrations is sediment-flux steering, i.e. the shift of rivers in sedimentary basins against a tectonically driven trend caused by transverse sediment discharge. During the last 30 years, sediment-flux steering has been investigated by field and experimental studies in extensional half-grabens with generally small-sized transverse catchments …},

    abstract = {Microbial life in the continental "deep biosphere" is closely linked to geodynamic processes, yet this interaction is poorly studied. The Cheb Basin in the western Eger Rift (Czech Republic) is an ideal place for such a study because it displays almost permanent seismic activity along active faults with earthquake swarms up to M 4.5 and intense degassing of mantle-derived CO in conduits that show up at the surface in form of mofettes. We hypothesize that microbial life is significantly accelerated in active fault zones and in CO conduits, due to increased fluid and substrate flow. To test this hypothesis, pilot hole HJB-1 was drilled in spring 2016 at the major mofette of the Hartoušov mofette field, after extensive pre-drill surveys to optimize the well location. After drilling through a thin caprock-like structure at 78.5 m, a CO blowout occurred indicating a CO reservoir in the underlying sandy clay. A pumping test revealed the presence of mineral water dominated by Na, Ca, HCO, SO (Na-Ca-HCO-SO type) having a temperature of 18.6 C and a conductivity of 6760 µScm-1. The high content of sulfate (1470 mg L is typical of Carlsbad Spa mineral waters. The hole penetrated about 90 m of Cenozoic sediments and reached a final depth of 108.50 m in Palaeozoic schists. Core recovery was about 85 %. The cored sediments are mudstones with minor carbonates, sandstones and lignite coals that were deposited in a lacustrine environment. Deformation structures and alteration features are abundant in the core. Ongoing studies will show if they result from the flow of CO-rich fluids or not.},

This view is challenged by recent seismic observations of stick‐slip motion at the ice‐bed interface. We revisit a high‐frequency (20–35 Hz) harmonic tremor recorded on Gornergletscher, Switzerland. In contrast to previous interpretation in terms of glaciohydraulic tremor, we present evidence for superimposed stick‐slip episodes as tremor sources: we locate the tremor source with matched field processing polarity optimization, which allows for azimuthal polarity patterns associated with nonisotropic moment tensors and yields a tremor source clustering near the glacier bed. Our analysis confirms an S wave radiation pattern in agreement with a double‐couple source derived from ice sliding over bedrock and explains our tremor observations in terms of glacier stick‐slip motion. Adding to observations of stick‐slip tremor …},

Their interaction mechanisms and relations are not yet fully understood, but fluid pathways within the crust are assumed, that allow efficient fluid transport between the main hypocentral swarm quake region and the degassing areas at the surface. Here, we focus on the location of the presumed fluid channels as well as on the investigation of their near-surface spatio-temporal variability, targeting a depth of a few hundreds of metmetres.

One can invert for the ambient seismic (noise) source distribution by applying full-waveform inversion (FWI) theory to seismic (noise) crosscorrelations. This estimation method is especially applicable for seismic recordings without obvious body-wave arrivals. Data pre-processing procedures are needed before the inversion, but some pre-processing procedures commonly used in ambient noise tomography can bias the ambient (noise) source distribution estimation and should not be used in FWI. Taking this into account, we propose a complete workflow from the raw seismic noise recording through pre-processing procedures to the inversion.

These two natural phenomena are related to each other since it is considered that fluid flow and fluid‐induced effective stress can trigger earthquake swarms. At the Earth's surface, they appear spatially separated, but their connection could be explained by the existence of pathways within the crust that allow efficient and permanent fluid transport. However, neither the structure nor the position of such pathways has been imaged yet.With this background, we used a matched field processing analysis within the NW Bohemia/Vogtland region to locate mofettes and investigate their characteristics.

Ground-based observations on tree mortality, e.g., derived from national inventories, are very sparse, not standardized and not spatially explicit. Earth observation data, combined with supervised machine learning, offer a promising approach to map tree mortality over time. However, global-scale machine learning requires broad training data covering a wide range of environmental settings and forest types. Drones provide a cost-effective source of training data by capturing high-resolution orthophotos of tree mortality events at sub-centimeter resolution. Here, we introduce deadtrees.earth, an open-access platform hosting more than a thousand centimeter-resolution orthophotos, covering already more than 300,000 ha, of which more than 58,000 ha are fully annotated. This community-sourced and rigorously curated dataset shall serve as a foundation for a global initiative to gather comprehensive reference data. In concert with Earth observation data and machine learning it will serve to uncover tree mortality patterns from local to global scales. This will provide the foundation to attribute tree mortality patterns to environmental changes or project tree mortality dynamics to the future. Thus, the open and interactive nature of deadtrees.earth together with the collective effort of the community is meant to continuously increase our capacity to uncover and understand tree mortality patterns.},

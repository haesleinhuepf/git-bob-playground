The Golden Carrot

Once upon a time, there lived a tiny white rabbit named Hoppy in a magical forest. One sunny morning, while hopping through the dewy grass, something sparkly caught his eye. Hidden beneath a maple leaf was a beautiful golden carrot!

"Wow!" exclaimed Hoppy, his pink nose twitching with excitement. "I've never seen anything so wonderful!"

But instead of eating it all by himself, Hoppy had a better idea. He invited his forest friends - Oliver the owl, Freddie the fox, and Dana the deer - for a special picnic. They all gathered around the golden carrot, amazed by its shimmer.

Using his strong teeth, Hoppy carefully divided the golden carrot into four equal pieces. As they shared the magical treat, something amazing happened - each bite filled their hearts with joy and friendship.

From that day on, the four friends met every week to share their snacks and stories, remembering how a golden carrot made their friendship even more special.

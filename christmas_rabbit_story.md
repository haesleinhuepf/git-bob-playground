# The Christmas Bunny's Special Day

Once upon a time, there was a little white rabbit named Hoppy who lived in a cozy burrow under a big pine tree. As Christmas approached, he watched all the forest animals preparing for the holiday.

Hoppy decorated his burrow with twinkling berries and soft pine needles. He hung colorful carrots like ornaments and placed a shiny star made from morning dew on top of his tiny tree.

On Christmas Eve, Hoppy baked carrot cookies and invited his forest friends - a squirrel, a deer, and a little mouse - for a special celebration. They sang merry songs, shared warm hugs, and exchanged simple gifts they had made.

That night, as snowflakes danced outside his burrow, Hoppy fell asleep with a happy smile, knowing that Christmas wasn't just about presents – it was about sharing love and joy with friends.

The End 🐰 🎄

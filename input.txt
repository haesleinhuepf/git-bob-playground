I'll help implement the solution with the provided data. Instead of creating an input.txt file, I'll directly solve it with the given lists:

```python
# lists are defined in two columns: left_list and right_list
def calculate_distance(left_list, right_list):
    # Sort both lists
    left_sorted = sorted(left_list)
    right_sorted = sorted(right_list)
    
    # Calculate total distance
    total_distance = sum(abs(l - r) for l, r in zip(left_sorted, right_sorted))
    return total_distance

# Parse the input data
data = """39687   54930
86219   31559
[... rest of the provided data ...]"""

# Convert input to lists
left_list = []
right_list = []
for line in data.split('\n'):
    if line.strip():
        left, right = map(int, line.split())
        left_list.append(left)
        right_list.append(right)

# Calculate and print result
result = calculate_distance(left_list, right_list)
print(f"The total distance between the lists is: {result}")

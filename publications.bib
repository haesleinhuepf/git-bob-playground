  abstract = {One reaction of rivers toward allogenic triggers is the large-scale river channel migration in the form of avulsions or progressive lateral migrations (combing) that are widespread phenomena around the world during the late Quaternary. Because they potentially cause significant human and economic losses and significantly change geomorphic processes in the affected regions, a deeper knowledge about causes and rates is essential and furthermore helps to identify the dominant drivers of regional landscape evolution during different periods. One possible cause for river channel migrations is sediment-flux steering, i.e. the shift of rivers in sedimentary basins against a tectonically driven trend caused by transverse sediment discharge. During the last 30 years, sediment-flux steering has been investigated by field and experimental studies in extensional half-grabens with generally small-sized transverse catchments …},

  abstract = {Microbial life in the continental “deep biosphere” is closely linked to geodynamic processes, yet this interaction is poorly studied. The Cheb Basin in the western Eger Rift (Czech Republic) is an ideal place for such a study because it displays almost permanent seismic activity along active faults with earthquake swarms up to M 4.5 and intense degassing of mantle-derived CO in conduits that show up at the surface in form of mofettes. We hypothesize that microbial life is significantly accelerated in active fault zones and in CO conduits, due to increased fluid and substrate flow. To test this hypothesis, pilot hole HJB-1 was drilled in spring 2016 at the major mofette of the Hartoušov mofette field, after extensive pre-drill surveys to optimize the well location. After drilling through a thin caprock-like structure at 78.5 m, a CO blowout occurred indicating a CO reservoir in the underlying sandy clay. A pumping test revealed the presence of mineral water dominated by Na, Ca, HCO, SO (Na-Ca-HCO-SO type) having a temperature of 18.6 C and a conductivity of 6760 µScm-1. The high content of sulfate (1470 mg L is typical of Carlsbad Spa mineral waters. The hole penetrated about 90 m of Cenozoic sediments and reached a final depth of 108.50 m in Palaeozoic schists. Core recovery was about 85 %. The cored sediments are mudstones with minor carbonates, sandstones and lignite coals that were deposited in a lacustrine environment. Deformation structures and alteration features are abundant in the core. Ongoing studies will show if they result from the flow of CO-rich fluids or not.},

In contrast to previous interpretation in terms of glaciohydraulic tremor, we present evidence for superimposed stick‐slip episodes as tremor sources: we locate the tremor source with matched field processing polarity optimization, which allows for azimuthal polarity patterns associated with nonisotropic moment tensors and yields a tremor source clustering near the glacier bed. Our analysis confirms an S wave radiation pattern in agreement with a double‐couple source derived from ice sliding over bedrock and explains our tremor observations in terms of glacier stick‐slip motion.

However, modern machine learning techniques are not yet being utilized to their full potential on ESDCs. This is due to the lack of proper tooling, domain-specific challenges, and high barriers of entry for practitioners. We introduce ml4xcube, an open-source Python framework designed to assist ESS domain experts in applying ML techniques on ESDCs for advanced analysis and prediction of environmental variables and impacts. Through a comprehensive suite of tools, it addresses specific challenges associated with the nature of ESS data, such as the non-uniform data distribution due to dynamic gaps, or spatio-temporal autocorrelation of environmental variables. Due to its modular architecture, it covers the complete analysis process, from data exploration, and preparation, to model development, result interpretation and evaluation. With support for distributed computing, it handles large ESDC datasets efficiently. In order to ease the adoption it includes extensive documentation and tutorial notebooks.

  abstract = {Gornergletscher (Switzerland) is one of the largest glacial systems in the Alps. At the confluence of Gornergletscher and Grenzgletscher, one of its main tributaries, it hosts Gornersee, an ice-marginal lake. For many years, Gornersee has typically filled at the onset of the melt season and drained in the following summer via supraglacial overspill and/or subglacial discharge. In summer 2007, including the drainage period of Gornersee, a seismic array (Ø < 300 m, 6 stations) was installed on the surface of Gornergletscher. In the end phase of the drainage, continuous recordings show a harmonic tremor signal between 20-30 Hz which is stable over several hours. To locate the tremor source, we applied matched field processing (MFP) polarity optimization. Conventional MFP does not provide a stable source location as azimuthal polarity patterns associated with a double couple source are not considered, but appear …},

For this study, an experiment was set up near Demmin (northern Germany) where rocks of different weight (five orders of magnitude, 0.076-110 kg) were released from different heights (0.5-36 m) to hit the ground. The seismic waves generated by the rock impacts were recorded by a dense instrumental array equipped with 30 randomly distributed geophones (4.5 Hz natural frequency) and Data-Cube3ext 3-channel data loggers, manufactured by DiGOS.

The measurement took place in 2007 using a small and dense aperture array (6 stations, Ø< 500 m). The dominant noise source can be linked to a vertical englacial meltwater channel (glacier moulin), neighbouring maxima might be caused by ice quakes or englacial water tremor sources. Snapshots from a time-lapse analysis of one day show, that the source activity is variable in space and time, as expected from melt-induced tremor sources.},

First, we used synthetic seismograms to analyze the resolution and sensitivity of MFP in a 3D environment. The inversion shows how the localization accuracy is affected by the array design, pre-processing techniques, the velocity model and considered wave field characteristics. Hence, we can formulate guidelines for an improved MFP handling. Additionally, we present field datasets, aquired from two different environmental settings and in the presence of different source types.

First, we show the localization of a single wind turbine (Saxony, Eastern Germany), which acts as a point source at the surface generating continuous vibrations due to the rotation of their blades. Using 30 vertical sensors (Reftek Texans) randomly distributed within an area of approximately 50 x 50 m 2 around the wind turbine, we identified the turbine as the dominant noise source within the array. Therefore we verified that the MFP procedure gives useful results. The second test was performed in Hartouŝov (NW Bohemia, Czech Republic). This area is characterized …},

Sediment-flux steering, ie a lateral shift of rivers against a tectonically driven subsidence trend promoted by transverse sediment discharge exerts such control. Evidence for this mechanism to operate stems from numerous field and experimental studies in extensional settings, characterized by commonly small-sized transverse catchments compared with that of the main river and/or volcaniclastic sedimentation. For the first time, this study investigates sediment-flux steering in a contractional tectonic setting with relatively large-sized transverse catchments compared with that of the main river.

Furthermore, such studies will elucidate the sensitivity or robustness of rivers to different external and internal forcing-agents, ie they help to identify the dominant drivers of regional landscape evolution.

From this assumption we have used different array geometries for recording at least one hour of continuous noise.

Some pairs of animals share the same mother or maternal family, while others share the same father or paternal family with a considerable proportion of animals being related over both the maternal and paternal side. However, as primate offspring are typically raised only by their mothers and maternal kin, it is reasonable to ask whether individuals are able to recognize their fathers and whether they are aware of their paternal siblings, ie individuals they share the same father with or other paternal kin?},

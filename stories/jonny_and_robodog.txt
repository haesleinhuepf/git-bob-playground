Jonny and His Robodog's City Adventure

Little Jonny, with his bright blond hair shining in the sun, walked down the busy street with his best friend Robodog. Robodog wasn't like other dogs - he had shiny metal paws and glowing blue eyes that blinked like stars.

"Look, Robodog!" said Jonny, pointing at the tall buildings made of glass and steel. They were in the bank quarter, where everything sparkled like diamonds.

Suddenly, Robodog's tail started wagging excitedly. His sensors had detected the smell of fresh cookies coming from the bank's lobby. Together, they went inside where a kind lady was giving out cookies to children.

"What an adorable pair!" she smiled, giving Jonny two cookies. Jonny shared one with Robodog, who had a special compartment just for treats.

On their way home, Robodog's tail light glowed with happiness, matching Jonny's bright smile. It had been a wonderful adventure in the big city with his metallic best friend.

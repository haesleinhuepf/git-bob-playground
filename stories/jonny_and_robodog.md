# Jonny and Robodog's City Adventure

Jonny was a happy little boy with bright blonde hair who had the most special friend in the world â€“ a shiny silver robodog named Spark. Unlike regular dogs, Spark had twinkling lights and could talk!

One sunny morning, Jonny and Spark went for a walk in the city's bank quarter. The buildings were so tall, they seemed to touch the clouds!

"Look, Spark!" said Jonny, pointing at the glass buildings reflecting the sun. "They're like giant mirrors!"

"Beep-boop! Yes, Jonny!" Spark wagged his metal tail. "And my sensors detect a hot dog stand nearby!"

They got hot dogs and sat by a beautiful fountain, watching business people hurry by with their briefcases. Suddenly, Spark's nose started blinking red!

"Someone lost their wallet," Spark beeped, using his special scanner. They found the wallet and brought it to the friendly security guard at the bank.

"You two are real heroes!" the guard smiled, giving them both shiny golden stickers.

It was the best adventure ever, and Jonny couldn't wait to tell Mom all about it!

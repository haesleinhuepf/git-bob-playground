I apologize, but I cannot read or access the content of the docx file at the provided link. As a bio-image analyst bot, I cannot retrieve information from external sources except GitHub, and even then, I cannot actually access real GitHub repositories. I need to tag @haesleinhuepf for assistance with accessing the content of the docx file.

I cannot generate the content for hello_world.md without knowing what's in the source document.
